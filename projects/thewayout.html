        <h2>"The Way Out"</h2>
        <p>"The Way Out" is a first-person escape room game prototype, developed as my final project to complete my game programming degree. I worked on this project both as a game designer and a programmer, taking full responsibility for concept development, puzzle design, and core gameplay implementation.</p>

        <h2>Concept & Theme</h2>
        <p>The game is set in a mysterious science laboratory, a theme I chose for its atmospheric potential and narrative intrigue. The goal was to create a coherent, immersive environment filled with logic-based puzzles that align with the game's setting and encourage critical thinking.</p>

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>Game design: Developed the overall concept and escape sequence, crafted all puzzles, and designed progression logic across rooms</p>

        <h2>Puzzle Progression</h2>

        <h3>Room 1: Chemical Mixing Puzzle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The player must discover hidden clues around the lab to determine the correct order and color combination of liquids to mix in flasks.</li>
            <li>Solving the puzzle unlocks access to the second room.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Room 2: Periodic Table Code Puzzle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clues hidden in the environment reference chemical elements.</li>
            <li>Players must match these elements with their atomic numbers to generate a numeric code.</li>
            <li>Entering the code into a keypad opens the third room.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Room 3: Ball Maze Puzzle (Inspired by Resident Evil)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A tilting maze structure contains a ball that must be navigated to the goal using physics-based interactions.</li>
            <li>This room challenges spatial awareness and fine control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final Room: Sliding Tile Puzzle (15 Puzzle)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A classic puzzle integrated into a digital console interface, providing a final test of logic before the player can escape.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Features</h2>
        <p>To enhance gameplay quality and reduce backtracking, I designed and implemented an in-game notepad. This allows players to jot down clues directly within the game, improving both immersion and usability.</p>

        <div class="project-conclusion">
            This project showcases my ability to create a full puzzle-driven gameplay experience from scratch, including atmosphere, progression, and usability features. It reflects my strength in designing engaging challenges and building them into a cohesive, immersive world.
