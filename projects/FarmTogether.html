        <h2>Farm Together+</h2>
        <p>This academic project focused on reimagining a classic single-player farming simulator by introducing new multiplayer gameplay systems to make the game more dynamic and engaging. As the game designer, I was tasked with creating three original mechanics that would expand the game’s depth and improve long-term player engagement.</p>

        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        <p>Design three innovative multiplayer mechanics to enhance the core farming simulator experience, encouraging collaboration, competition, and emergent gameplay.</p>

        <h2>Mechanic 1 – Shared Market & Group Orders</h2>
        <p>This mechanic introduces a cooperative economy system where players can access a shared marketplace and work together on large group orders.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players can split production responsibilities based on crop or product type</li>
            <li>Resources can be shared between players to fulfill high-reward orders faster</li>
            <li>Successful group deliveries award time-based bonuses and higher payouts</li>
            <li>Promotes strategic coordination and team management</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="project-conclusion">
            Why it works: It transforms routine farming tasks into collaborative economic challenges, rewarding teamwork and planning.
        </div>

        <h2>Mechanic 2 – Co-op Farm Events</h2>
        <p>This system brings limited-time multiplayer events into the game to break routine gameplay and introduce real-time cooperation or competition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players work together or compete in seasonal challenges (e.g., Harvest Festival, Animal Race, Crafting Tournaments)</li>
            <li>Events offer exclusive, time-limited rewards such as decorations, tools, or building upgrades</li>
            <li>Encourages players to return regularly, participate socially, and diversify their gameplay</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="project-conclusion">
            Why it works: These events add freshness and excitement, while encouraging social interaction and reward-driven engagement.
        </div>

        <h2>Mechanic 3 – Reputation System</h2>
        <p>This dynamic player reputation system adds depth and moral choice to multiplayer interactions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players can visit each other's farms to help with tasks</li>
            <li>Good actions (like assisting with tasks or donations) increase reputation</li>
            <li>Negative actions (like sabotage or theft) reduce reputation</li>
            <li>High-reputation players unlock premium contracts and exclusive rewards</li>
            <li>Low-reputation players gain access to rogue gameplay options:</li>
            <li>Stealing high-quality produce</li>
            <li>Sabotaging rival farms by damaging goods or delaying growth</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="project-conclusion">
            Why it works: It introduces risk vs. reward dynamics, encourages roleplaying, and supports both altruistic and mischievous playstyles.
        </div>

        <h2>Design Focus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Foster player cooperation and long-term collaboration</li>
            <li>Introduce ethical choices and diverse playstyles</li>
            <li>Break up routine gameplay with emergent events and social mechanics</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="project-conclusion">
            This project showcases my ability to design modular game systems that enrich existing gameplay loops, deepen social interaction, and create meaningful choices for players. It reflects my interest in balancing mechanics that encourage both cooperation and playful conflict within multiplayer environments.

            Note: This was a fictional project created for educational purposes. The original game does not exist.
