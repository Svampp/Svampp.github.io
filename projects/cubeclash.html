        <h2>Cube Clash</h2>
        <p>Cube Clash is a conceptual design for a multiplayer team-based battle game, created as part of an academic assignment focused on game design. In this project, I worked exclusively as a game designer, responsible for developing the entire gameplay concept, player roles, core mechanics, and arena layout.</p>

        <h2>Core Concept</h2>
        <p> Cube Clash is a fast-paced team battle game where all characters are cubes sliding across a frictionless battlefield. Players attack by jumping onto enemies or using charged special abilities. The game is played between two teams of 4–6 players, with roles assigned randomly at the beginning of each match.</p>
        <p>Each team includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Healer</li>
            <li>1 Heavy (Big Cube)</li>
            <li>2–4 Regular Players</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Movement: Smooth gliding across a flat arena</li>
            <li>Attack: Jumping onto opponents or activating a special ability</li>
            <li>Special Abilities: Charged by dealing damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Victory is achieved by eliminating all enemy players.</p>

        <h2>Arena Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A flat battlefield, bordered with decorative cube and rectangle structures</li>
            <li>A pyramid-like structure made of cubes in the center, with a floating cube on top</li>
            <li>The floating cube changes color to reflect which team is currently winning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Teams & Roles</h2>
        <h3>Team: Rebel Team</h3>
        <h4>Regular Player</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 10</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Sends out shockwaves that deal double damage and knock back enemies</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Healer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 10</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Creates a protective field for self and one ally for 5 seconds (no damage taken or dealt during this time)</li>
            <li>Heals the ally for 50 HP</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Big Cube</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 20</li>
            <li>Slower movement</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Emits a massive pulse dealing 20 damage to all enemies</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team: Attractor Team</h3>
        <h4>Regular Player</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 10</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Links to one teammate (except healer), dealing double damage together</li>
            <li>Incoming damage is shared between both players</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Healer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 10</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Links to one teammate, creating a protective field (same as Rebel healer)</li>
            <li>Heals for 50 HP over 5 seconds</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Big Cube</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>HP: 100 | Damage: 20</li>
            <li>Slower movement</li>
            <li>Special Ability: Links to up to three teammates, and next attack deals triple damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create meaningful team synergy through complementary roles</li>
            <li>Ensure dynamic gameplay with charged abilities and cooperative mechanics</li>
            <li>Emphasize visual clarity through geometric simplicity and symmetry</li>
            <li>Encourage both tactical positioning and aggressive play through role diversity</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="project-conclusion">
            This project highlights my ability to design multiplayer combat systems, role balancing, and visually readable level design. It reflects my interest in creating original mechanics and synergistic team interactions within simple but strategic game environments.
