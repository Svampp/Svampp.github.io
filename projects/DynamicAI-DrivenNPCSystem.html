        <h2>Dynamic AI-Driven NPC System</h2>
        <p>
            During the Junction 2025 Hackathon, I developed a versatile gameplay mechanic centered around AI-driven NPC behavior that can be adapted to various genres — from RPGs and simulations to shooters and survival games. My role was to design the core concept and functionality of this system, focusing on creating emergent, reactive gameplay shaped by player interaction.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concept</h2>
        <p>This mechanic proposes a system in which every NPC is controlled by a dynamic AI, with behavior shaped by a variety of environmental and player-driven factors.</p>
        <p>NPCs are not static or scripted; they react, adapt, and evolve based on the context of the game world, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player choices and actions (e.g., kindness, aggression, alliances, betrayals)</li>
            <li>In-game environmental factors (e.g., weather, time of day, location-based threats)</li>
            <li>NPC emotional memory, tracking past events and adjusting future behavior accordingly</li>
            <li>Reputation system, influencing how individual or groups of NPCs treat the player</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <h3>Contextual Decision-Making</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NPCs assess multiple parameters (e.g., weather, threats, player reputation) before choosing an action — fight, flee, offer help, or ignore.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Adaptive Relationships</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Each NPC tracks its history with the player: past kindness can lead to assistance, while repeated aggression can cause fear, avoidance, or even retaliation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>World-State Influence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>NPC behavior adapts to game world changes. For example, villagers might take shelter or change routines when it rains or during dangerous events.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Genre-Agnostic Design</h3>
        <p>The system is designed to plug into various genres:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a shooter: enemies might call for backup based on perceived threat.</li>
            <li>In a farming sim: villagers might help or sabotage you depending on your social choices.</li>
            <li>In an RPG: NPC factions evolve their stance based on moral alignment and world state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create living, breathing worlds that feel more responsive and immersive</li>
            <li>Replace static quest givers with believable, memory-aware characters</li>
            <li>Enable player agency to shape their journey through interaction, not just narrative scripting</li>
            <li>Support emergent storytelling through organic AI behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>Games today often rely on pre-written scripts and branching dialogue, which can feel repetitive or artificial. This system enables a richer, more personalized experience, where each playthrough can feel different based on how the player interacts with the world and its inhabitants.</p>

            This project reflects my passion for designing systems that bring depth, consequence, and emotional weight to gameplay — helping players form real connections with virtual worlds.
